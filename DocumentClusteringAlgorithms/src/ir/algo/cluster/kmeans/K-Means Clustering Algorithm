--------------- K-Means algorithm --------------------------------

1) Clustering is the process of grouping a set of objects into classes of similar objects
   - Documents within a cluster should be similar.
   - Documents from different clusters should be dissimilar.

2) This algorithm Works based on vector space model.
   - The relatedness between vectors is measured by Euclidean distance.
   
Algorithm
 Objective: For any document d, minimize the squared distance from its cluster’s centroid.
 1) Select K random documents to act as seeds, i.e. initial cluster centroids.
 2) For each document d, measure the Euclidean distance with all centroids, assign the doc to the nearest cluster.
 3) Recompute the centroids for all clusters.
 4) Repeat from step 2 until the stopping criteria has been met (for ex, stabilized.)
