- This project is an attempt to understand and implement all the clustering algorithms one by one. 
- I am passionate about Information retrieval and am exploring all the subtopics one after another.
- That's the reason for the parent package being ir.algo (information retrieval.algorithms) eventhough the individual algorithms are not purely IR-based algos.
- Only K-Means algorithm is implemented as of now. More algorithms will be added in future.
- This entire file structure can act as an Eclipse project.
